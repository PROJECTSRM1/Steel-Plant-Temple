        <p className="intro-text">
          The <strong>Ayyappa Swamy Temple</strong> upholds the age-old Vedic tradition of performing{" "}
          <strong>Yagnas</strong> and <strong>Homas</strong> â€” sacred fire rituals that purify the mind, body, and surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Hindu philosophy, fire (<em>Agni</em>) is considered the divine messenger that carries the devoteeâ€™s prayers
          and offerings to the gods. Every Yagna performed at the temple is a sacred act of surrender, invoking blessings
          for peace, prosperity, and spiritual protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flickering flames of the sacred fire represent the <strong>light of wisdom</strong>, while the offerings made
          into it symbolize the sacrifice of ego, negativity, and worldly attachments. Participating in or sponsoring a Yagna
          helps devotees experience inner harmony, removes obstacles, and attracts divine grace from Lord Ayyappa and the presiding deities.
